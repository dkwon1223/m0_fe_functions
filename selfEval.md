# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I feel very good about the learning and work completed today. I feel
    that I have a solid understanding of function syntax, parameters, arguments,
    and return values/statements. I am most proud of attempting to complete as much
    bonus work as I could throughout the assessments thus far.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
    - I believe functions are an indispensable tool for applications due to their flexibility,
    reusability, and convenience. When it comes to performing certain algorithms or simple tasks
    through blocks of code, the ability to make such tasks reusable with different inputs and outputs is invaluable to saving time and improving efficiency of the components of applications.
